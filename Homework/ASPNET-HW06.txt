## ASP.NET HW06

1. What is unit testing as defined by the book?

*a form of testing in which individual components are isolated from the rest of the application so their behavior can be thoroughly validated*

2. What is the convention for creating unit tests in ASP.NET Core applications?

*create a separate VS project to hold the unit tests, each of which is defined as a method in a C# Class*

3. Name three unit test project tools used for ASP.NET Core applications.

*MS Test; NUnit; XUnit*

4. What is the convention for naming unit tests in ASP.NET Core applications?

*<applicationName>.Tests*

5. What is the convention for naming the test classes in AP.NET Core? What is the convention for
naming the methods in the test classes?

*The name of the test method describes what the test does - the name of the class describes whats being tested*

6. What is the purpose of the Fact attribute in Xunit? (not in book) What is the purpose of the Theory
attribute in Xunit?

*[fast] is Applied to each method to indicate that it is a test - [theory] is applied to denote a parameterized test that is true for a subset of data*

7. Describe the different elements of the AAA testing pattern.

*arrange/act/assert - Arrange: setup cnditions for the test; act: perform the test; Assert: verify the result meets desired expectations*

8. Describe the use of the methods in the Assert class. Describe the purpose, parameters, and return
value of the Assert.Equals() method.
```
Assert.Equal(expected, result) //asserts the result is equal to the expected outcome
Assert.NotEqual(expected, result) //asserts the result is not equal to the expected outcome
Assert.True(result) //Asserts the result is true
Assert.False(result)
Assert.Is[Not]Type(expected, result) //Asserts the result is [not] of a specific type
Assert.Is[Not]Null(result) //Asserts the result is [not] Null
[Not]InRange(result, low, high) //asserts result [does not] falls between low and high
Throws(exception, expression)	//Asserts that the specified expression throws a specific exception type
```

9. What is the key to isolating a component for testing?

*use C# interfaces to change the data source used by the controller*

10. What is a mocking package? What does it do?

*creates fake/mock objects for tests - "Moq" is an example of a Mocking package*

11. (not in book) What is the difference between the Setup() and the SetupGet() methods of Moq?

*Setup is used for mocking a property, SetupGet is specifically for mocking the getter of a property*
